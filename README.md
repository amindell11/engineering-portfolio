# Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my Engineering Portfolio! This repository showcases a curated selection of my electrical engineering projects, designs, and technical experiences from both academic and practical applications.

## About Me

I'm Arye Mindell, an electrical engineer passionate about signal processing, embedded systems, audio technology, and the intersection of engineering with creative arts. My background includes experiences at Aurora Flight Sciences and Humatics Inc., as well as involvement in STEM education and mentoring through FIRST Robotics and LMU Hillel.

## Portfolio Highlights

- **Operational Amplifier Design:** Designed and simulated a multi-stage operational amplifier meeting strict gain, input/output impedance, and bandwidth specifications.
- **Prime Counter Circuit:** Developed a synchronous digital counter implementing sequential logic to cycle through prime numbers using JK flip-flops.
- **Robotics and Embedded Systems:** Contributed to FIRST Robotics, developing reusable libraries, autonomous path-following algorithms, computer vision systems, and real-time web dashboards.
- **Sensor Vehicle Prototyping (OSV):** Engineered sensor rigs and drivetrain systems, addressing challenges in robotics prototyping, structural design, and system integration.

Explore the individual projects for deeper insights into my approach to electrical engineering, design processes, and technical problem-solving.
