# Junior Lab Documentation

This folder serves as an overview and reference point for my two semesters of Junior Lab coursework in Electrical Engineering. Each semester's lab experiments, reports, and code are organized into separate repositories for clarity and ease of navigation.

## Semester Repositories
- **[Junior Lab Semester 1](https://github.com/amindell11/JLab1)**
- **[Junior Lab Semester 2](https://github.com/amindell11/JLab-II)**

These repositories contain detailed documentation, experiment data, code implementations, and analyses from each semester's coursework.

## Sample Lab Reports
Included here are several representative lab reports demonstrating my approach to data analysis, experimental procedures, and technical writing:

- [Operational Amplifier Design Report](https://github.com/amindell11/engineering-portfolio/blob/main/Junior_Design_Lab/Mindell_Arye_Lab_6_Prelab_Report.pdf)
- [Prime Number Counter Report](https://github.com/amindell11/engineering-portfolio/blob/main/Junior_Design_Lab/Mindell_Arye_Expt_8_Prelab.pdf)

Please visit the semester-specific repositories for full access to all lab materials and comprehensive documentation.
